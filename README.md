This project features a HaiIntel-style floating chat launcher that opens into a modern AI chat window with a dark, minimal theme. It is built using React/Vite with Tailwind CSS for styling and Framer Motion for smooth animations and chat interactions. The UI includes streaming AI responses, typing indicators, user and AI message bubbles, and follow-up suggestions powered by static mock JSON. Chat history is stored using LocalStorage for seamless session continuity. Tailwind color themes and animation patterns were refined with help from ChatGPT, ensuring a polished HaiIntel-inspired visual experience. All AI-assisted code was manually reviewed and validated.
